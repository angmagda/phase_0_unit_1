// My role in the group is: Translate user stories into pseudocode
 

// Here is my part of the challenge:

//pseudocode
{
	
	// Define function for sum of elements;
	// Set parameters;
		// Iterate with 'for' all the numbers in an array to get the total sum;
	// Return sum value;

	// Define function to get the mean of elements;
	// Set parameters;
		// Call the sum function and divide the total by the number of elements in the array;
	// Return mean value;

	// Define function to get the median of an array;
	// Set parameters;
		// Sort array;
		// Define another var (middle or half) to store the value of sorted array / 2;
		// Set this var equal to the array and index into it applying the Math.floor method to the array lenght -1 divided by two;
		// Return half value;

}

// My reflection

// When I received the user's stories I thought the challenge was easy, but then I started to think how to solve the problem and I
// realized it was not. Then I just started to write several ways to do it, to code (only in paper), to make little tests, 
// and when I found the best way to do it, I wrote the pseudocode.
// I'm finding pseudocoding a little complicated, for me it's like thinking how to solve the challenge with code and then go back
// to pseudocode. I know that it's a better practice, so I'll continue to learn to do it efficiently.
// I found the experience enjoyable and not tedious at all.
// My group's solution passed all the tests, I'm so happy!
