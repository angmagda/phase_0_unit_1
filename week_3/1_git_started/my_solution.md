## Release 2: Basic Git Commands
Define the following commands and describe how they work/what they do.  


#### add

git add - adds file contents to the staging area. 
If the file is new, it initially adds the file to your staging area. If the file is already tracked, you still need to call git add to add new modifications to your staging area.																		

#### branch

git branch - lists all the available branches. 
git branch (branchname) - creates a new branch.

#### checkout

git checkout - switches between branches.

#### clone

git clone - copies a git repository so you can look at it or start modifying it. You run the code 'git clone [url]'

#### commit

git commit - saves a snapshot of the staging area. Records all the changes.

#### fetch

git fetch - will synchronize you with another repository. It updates new branches and data from a remote repo.

#### log

git log - show commit history of a branch. Shows all the commit messages that have lead up to the snapshot you are currently on.

#### merge

git merge - merges  a branch context into your current branch.

#### pull

git pull - Will basically run a 'git fetch' immediately followed by a 'git merge' of the branch on the remote repo.

#### push

git push - Updates a remote repo with the changes you have made locally.

#### reset

git reset - undoes changes and commits.

#### rm

git rm - removes files from the staging area entirely, so that it's not included in the next commit snapshot, thereby effectively deleting it.

#### status

git status - lets you view the status of your files in the working directory and staging area.
