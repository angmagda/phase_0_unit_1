* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1. I didn't ask any questions. I have a lot, though. I checked the codecademy HTML/CSS course, the w3schools.com page and all the resources listed in the challenge.
2. Definitely the relative, absolute positions are not my thing. Positions hate me, hahaha. I couldn't make the caption show on top of the image. Another concept that is not that clear is when I want to give a class to al element that is within another element and so on. I figured out how pseudo-classes work, and how the box model works.
3. Another boot shared this page http://cssdesk.com/ where we can actually see our html/css page, make changes, and see how it works. It was really helpful. I could set the build system to show your work in Sublime, but when I tried the Ctrl+B it kept sending an error because it couldn't find the file...
I learned that there's a way to copy all the CSS of a website and download it to your desktop and then use it!
4. In most of them I feel really confident, except the position :(
5. I really enjoyed the html and adding classes, attributes, etc. Adding pseudo-classes was really enjoyable, too.
6. I found terribly tedious the positioning of the caption on top of the image. I did all kind of changes, review the resources you gave us, searched in other websites...definitely there is something I'm missing. Positions hate me.
