## 2. [Open Source and Repo Setup](2_set_up_repo/readme.md) Reflection

* Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person
* Describe what open source means
* What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
* Assess the importance of using licenses
* What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. To create a repository on GitHub, first you sign in your account, then you click the "Create new repository" button. Then, you fill out the new repository form. You need to be sure to name your repository with your username, should be public, check the "initialize this project with a README" and add an MIT license. Finally, you click the "Create repository" button. Click on Settings and add a check to "Issues".
2. Open source is the practice of sharing how a computer program was made, (code, design), and allowing anyone to make changes to it, or use it to do other programs.
3. I think it's a double edged sword. It depends a lot in the integrity other people have. It makes me feel a little nervous. On the other hand, the fact that someone is sharing his/her knowledge and work with me, makes me feel trustworthy and responsible of what I do with that work.
4. Licensing is about more than just the code. You need to consider carefully all the license options. The key is to have a clear sense of who will use it and what is meant to be accomplished by the code.
5. The repository concept, what open-source means, why we need to choose a license. I didn't understand all the licensing vocabulary and differences between one or the other license, but I have a general idea. Sometimes I doubt my English is good enough to understand all this. It looks like Chinese to me, jajaja.
6. I only read this article http://www.softwarelicensingreport.com/articles/356466-importance-choosing-right-open-source-license.htm
7. It helped me to understand the differences in a simpler way.
