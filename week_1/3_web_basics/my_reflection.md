## 3. [Web Basics](3_web_basics/readme.md) Reflection

* What 2 new things did you learn about the web?
* What are some important things to remember when setting up your HTML site?
* How did you feel when you saw your web page live?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I have learned that: a) The Web and Internet are not the same thing! b) There's a lot of work behind a web page...uff! Web browsers, web servers, web sites, web applications, DNS...sometimes you don't realize all of this because everything happens so fast...you just type an address, hit enter, and it is there!
2. You need a domain name and hosting service. 
You need to remember that there are web standards to meet. 
	a. The site should have valid HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
	b. Meet accessibility standards.
	c. Meet semantic guidelines.
	d. Have valid meta data.
	e. Have proper character encoding.
You need to have a clear idea of what's the purpose of the site.
If you are going to build it yourself, you need a Text editor and a web browser. If not, contact a team of web development professionals.
3. Excited! Well, at the beginning I felt like if I've done something wrong because there was an error message, then I read it and waited for the 10 minutes..and there it was!
4. I feel more comfortable with the GitHub application now that we've clone, edit, commit, and syncronize a repo. Not that much with working from the terminal, though. I tried but I haven't succeed at it...which terminal should I use? Git Bash, Git Shell, Power Shell...?
Other concepts that I understand better now are domain name, IP address, browsers, the difference between websites and web apps. Not that much the DNS delay thing.
