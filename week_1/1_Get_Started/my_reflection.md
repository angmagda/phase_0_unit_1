## 1. [Git and Github](1_get_started/readme.md) Reflection

* What struggles did you have setting up git and GitHub? What did you learn in the process?
* Write an explanation of and compare git and GitHub to a non-technical audience. 
* Describe what version control is and how GitHub helps with it.
* Why do developers use version control (git)? Does that make sense to you? Why or why not?
* What doesn't make sense? What does?

1. I didn't struggle with the setting up. The difficult part is to understand how they work. I learned that Git is better than other version control softwares because it takes like snapshots of your work and you don't lose any previous work, as long as you save it. I learned that Git and GitHub are not the same thing
2. Git is a program that allows you to save different versions of your work. You can download it to your computer.
GitHub is like an online center where you can store your work and then access to it from any other place. It is not in your computer, it's online, so it's very important to save it there.
3. Version control keeps track of the changes you make to a file. GitHub allows different people to make changes in the same file so you can work on a project and keep track of all the changes.
4. Developers use it because they can all work on a project or program, add code, etc., at the same time. It totally makes sense to me. 
5. Even if you're not a developer you can help each other, make changes to anything you're working on with people in different places and not be afraid of losing parts or the whole project, because of version control. You don't waste time saving something in a USB then the other person makes changes, then give it back, and so on.
