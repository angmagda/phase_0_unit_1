* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)

* What questions did you ask during this challnge? What resources did you find to help you answer them?  
* What concepts are you having trouble with, or did you just figure something out? If so, what?  
* Did you learn any new skills or tricks?
* How confident are you with each of the Learning Competencies for this challenge? 
* Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy?
* Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?

1. I learned that there's a lot of work behind a website. The design part is the most important one (besides the actual coding of course) because it involves the user's needs and at the end that's all that matters! Through a very good design you can match users' needs with your business strategy.
2. I like it a lot! I really enjoyed this part. Now I realized that we should have seen the design/wireframing part before actually done the site and blog posts (well, that's my opinion).
3. Some of the questions I had, were: "What is a UX designer?","What's Ambidextrous thinking?", "Why the UCD design isn't applied?" I just clicked the link to ambdextrous to undestand it's meaning. The article itself helped me to undestand why the UCD design cannot be applied in most cases. This resource helped me undestand what a UX designer does: http://www.sitepoint.com/ux-designer-actually/
4. I have figured out that this is something I really like!
5. The wirify trick is a really good one, however, in one of the websites didn't show all the sections.
6. I feel confident, I don't wanna say "very" but I understood quite well this section.
7. I enjoyed the readings and trying to apply it to my favorite websites.
8. I didn't enjoy that I couldn't convey my opinion the way I wanted. I lack the vocabulary needed to express and communicate in English the way I do in Spanish.
