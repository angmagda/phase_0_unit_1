## 4.[Beginning HTML and CSS](4_beginning_HTML_CSS/readme.mc) Reflection

* What makes sense to your about HTML? What doesn't? 
* What seems good and bad about HTML?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. To me, it makes sense the way is structured. There are not many elements, so it's easy to remember, and attributes look like normal English. What doesn't make sense to me is all the <meta> stuff, I don't understand.
2. Everything seems good, I didn't see something bad about it. Is there something wrong with it?
3. Now I understand why HTML and CSS work together.
