Take a moment to reflect on reading other people's responses regarding their fears about DBC. How did that make you feel? Did you feel better, worse, or something else all together? How has your experience this week influenced your feelings? All feelings are welcome and ok. Just take a moment to think about it and write it down. 

I feel no more alone. Everyone is working really hard, most people feel nervous, excited, convinced that this is a great experience. I feel much better than at the beginning of phase_0, I'm exhausted, but happy that I finished on time the challenges this week 1, woohoo! I'm still worried about the pairing sessions and the GPSs...I'm not good at communicating with English words, and I'm afraid of saying something that for the other person means something different and make a total mess.
After watching the Fireside Chat with Shereef, I feel more confident about this experience, but with lots of questions too.
