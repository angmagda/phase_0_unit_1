## 8. [Comparing Favorite Websites](8_technical_blog/readme.md) Reflection

Blog url: http://angmagda.github.io/unit1_projects/week1_technical_blog.html

Reflect on the process of researching and writing a blog post. It doesn't have to be long. Did you enjoy this? Did you get comments or views? Did you find the blog helpful to your learning? Did you find it cumbersome? Which parts did you feel best about and which did you feel less certain about?

I enjoyed a part of it. Obviously, my English is not good enough to become a blogger. The words I know are simple and not fancy at all. It took longer than I expected. At the end, I couldn't get my images to show on the blog, it was frustrating. There's something I'm just not seeing.

Of course it was helpful! I've never done it in my life. I found it a little uncomfortable, yes. Why should I deny it?
I feel better about the HTML/CSS programming in general, and of course I'm getting used to the navigation through repos and the github app.
I feel less certain about why the images don't show!! I double checked the syntax, that they were in the correct folder, changed names, changed file type, slashes, etc...it's because I'm working on a Windows machine? Help!
