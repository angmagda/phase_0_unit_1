# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 
* How will you combat that? 
* What techniques will you try?
* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

1. My biggest time management challenge is to balance the time between my family responsibilities and phase 0 challenges. This last two weeks I've put a lot of time into DBC work and my family is starting to feel my absence. 
2. I'll set specific hours to work my phase 0 week's challenges; if I don't finish, I'll try not to feel stressed and focus on giving quality time to my family. 
3. 	a. I'll meditate at least 5 minutes everyday. I used to do it and I truly believe it works.
	b. I'll try the pomodoro technique.
4. The overall plan is to meditate, exercise and set the time for each activity and stick to it. Spend time with my family and have my home responsibilities done on time, too. Forget about all the things to do, and focus on one at the time.
