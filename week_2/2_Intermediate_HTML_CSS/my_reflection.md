# U1.W2: Intermediate HTML and CSS Reflection

* What do you think about web standards? Are they good or bad?
* Does the standard structure make sense to you? Why or why not?
* Do you like the new HTML5 elements, such as `<header>`, `footer`, and `nav`? Why or why not?
* Why is reset.css necessary? 
* What browsers have you used? Did you ever notice that sites looked different in different browsers? Do you think it's good or bad that they do?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I think web standards are good to promote consistency in the design code which makes up a web page. That way web pages display correctly in most browsers.
2. It totally makes sense. As a person that is learning how to design websites, is really helpful to know standarized font sizes, widths,etc.
3. I like them because instead of having a lot of divs you use the one that better fits that part in your web page. I don't understand the outline completely, though. In this challenge there was a part where we used some of the new elements and because the outline works differently, a part of the page changed. 
4. Because different browsers have different default styles for HTML, and this may change the way you have designed your website, it's a common practice to use the reset.css. According to what I've read is not always necessary to apply it, people differ on this matter. Basically, you need it to overwrite the browser's default styles and then add your CSS to ensure your website will look the way you planned it.
5. I've used IE, Safari, Firefox and Chrome. Because normally I don't check the same sites in different browsers, I haven't notice this changes so far. Why would they do that? I think it shouldn't be that way.
