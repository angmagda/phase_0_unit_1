# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. A responsive web design is the one which content can be scaled down or up according to the browser's resolution and devices. Are built on a fluid grid and use media queries. It's an excelent practice since there are a lot of new technologies and as a designer you never know from where the user is going to access or browse your website.
2. Well, all these new technologies use different resolutions, so they have changed web design in the sense that as a designer you don't have the control over how the user is going to see your content, and be happy with it. You can use a responsive design and get the best out of it.
Technology is always changing, improving, adapting. I'm sure that in the future there are going to be more devices, apps, games, etc., that will challenge web design further. 
3. I'm not sure, but blind people probably with braille keyboards, with voiced instructions, sounds...color blinded with different color schemes, and low-sighted with bigger resolutions. 
I definitely believe that we MUST design for all types of disabilities more than we are doing now.
4. Some ideas are that we need more apps for people with any type of disability. This is something I've been thinking for a time now, since in my daughter's school there are a lot of children with a kind of cognitive disability, my daughter herself has dyslexia and other learning problems. I don't know how to approach web design in this matter, but is something I may enjoy doing. Web design is much more difficult than I imagined. 
For me, what doesn't make sense is to still design in a fixed way. I read that it has nothing wrong to do so, but since a lot of people access the Internet from smartphones, tablets, and so, is hard to imagine why you would like a fixed design.
