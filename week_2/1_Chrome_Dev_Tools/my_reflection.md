# U1.W2: Chrome Dev Tools Challenge Reflection

* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. The DOM is a programming interface that shows the HTML elements with its CSS. It's arranged in a tree format.  You can access from the DOM to make changes in HTML and CSS files without actually doing everything on the file itself and then updating on the server to see the changes on the website. 
What makes sense to me is why this is so useful. You can play a lot with the HTML elements attributes and CSS styles, so when you find something you really like, you can save the changes!
What doesn't make sense to me, is that I couldn't create another element in the HTML part. Probably I didn't know how to do it.
I didn't undestand very well the JavaScript part.
2. Well, my site has nothing, hahaha. Only a couple of links in an unordered list and an h1 header. I haven't linked any CSS stylesheet to it so it has a very poor design. On the other hand, when I saw the wordpress site, was full of elements and <scripts>, I'm not sure what they do, but there were a lot! The CSS was much better, with more specific classes and ids.
3. I liked it, it was fun and different. It was better than in the code school's challenges online because some things were not working quite well there.
4. The concept of DOM is clearer now that I've seen it!
5. There was so much to do in this challenge that I didn't look for other resorces. I just sticked to the ones you gave us.
