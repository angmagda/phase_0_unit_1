# U1.W2: Design, User Experience, and creating your website Reflection

My Website url: http://angmagda.github.io/

Discuss the following:
* What did you learn about design and user experience? 
* Do you like design and user experience? Was it fun working on your site, the plan, and/or the wireframe? (If you hated it, that's OK too)
* What was your process? What worked and didn't work?
* What would you like to add or change about the site next?
* Was it difficult to apply the material you learned? Did you find anything in your research you thought was super cool?
* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

1. I learned that it requieres a lot of time, and work to come up with a design that could be accessible to most users. Is really difficult to accomplish all this things with what I know.
2. I like design and user experience, I think is vital to a website's success. At the beginning it was fun, ideas and wishes...but I ended up putting a lot of hours on the coding, and that wasn't fun anymore...I'm really tired.
3. I think that having a plan worked. What didn't work for me was trying to apply the grid.css and the media queries. I realized that I didn't understand how they worked too late. Follow along other tutorials didn't work either.   
4. I'd love to add a slide.
5. Yes, very difficult. You think you understand something and then you apply it and it doesn't work. You go back through the resources given, look for other resources, tutorials, etc., it's frustating. I think all the responsive design, the grid, wow! I didn't understand it but I think is super cool.
6. I don't know if I should write the ones I find in Spanish.
